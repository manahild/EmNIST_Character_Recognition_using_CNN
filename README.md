# EmNIST_Character_Recognition_using_CNN
This project focuses on training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize characters from the Extended MNIST (EMNIST) dataset. The EMNIST dataset is a set of handwritten character digits derived from the NIST Special Database 19 and converted to a 28x28 pixel image format and dataset structure that directly matches the MNIST dataset.
